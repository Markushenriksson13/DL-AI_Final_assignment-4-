            although the current reduction rates are not sufficient to meet the Paris climate goals. Without additional measures,

               - Implementation: Gradual installation of solar panels and sourcing green electricity
            
            3. **Optimize the supply chain for sustainability**
               - Potential Impact: 25-35% reduction in indirect emissions
               - Implementation: Introduce sustainability criteria for suppliers and local sourcing
            
            4. **Implement a comprehensive waste management program**
               - Potential Impact: 30% reduction in waste generation and an increase in recycling rate to 80%
               - Implementation: Waste audits, employee training, and partnerships with recycling companies
