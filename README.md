## Setting Up the Development Environment

Follow the steps below to create and activate a virtual environment and install the required Python dependencies.

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

Run the following command to create a virtual environment using Python 3.10:

```bash
python3.10 -m venv venv
```
This will create a folder named venv in the project root.

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment with the following command:

#### On Linux/macOS:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
#### On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
With the virtual environment active, install the project's dependencies from the requirements.txt file using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
